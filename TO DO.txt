Add second poverty indicator--child poverty rate--from Annie E. Casey Foundation.

Load the  AFGR, SAAR, and ELSI data into one data frame.

Do computations and remake data frame using the principles of Tidy data.

Column 1 = School Districts
Column 2 = Year
Column 3 = Total Enrollments
Column 4 = FRL <- Total FRL / Total Enrollments
Column 5 = 8GC.KDE <- Diploma Recipients / 8GrE.SAAR

etc.  That should be enough to load the gapminder in google.
